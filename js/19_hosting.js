//Hosting
/*
In Javascript, hosting is a mechanism where variable and function declarations are
moved (or  "Hoisted") to the top of their scope before code execution. This means 
that you can use variables and functions before declaring them in the code. However,
it's essential to note that only declarations are hoisted-not initialization
or assignments.

//in js fucnion hoisting are fully hoisted can call brfor declred


// function hello(){
//     console.log("hello world");
    
// }
// hello()

// hello()
// function hello(){
//     console.log("hello world");
    
// }






// console.log(x); //when tried with var its undefined
// var x="hello"
